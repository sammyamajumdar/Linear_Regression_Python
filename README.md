1) This code is the Python implementation of the Linear Regression problem on AndrewNg's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.  
This simple machine learning model predicts profits for a food truck.  
Dataset is downloaded from the course assignment under week 1.      

2) Added the solution to the Multivariate Linear Regression problem which predicts the Housing Prices in Portland Oregon based on 2 parameters : number of bedrooms and 
Size of the house in square feet.    

3) Logistic Regression is implementated to predict admission probability of a student based on their grades in previous 2 semesters. Dataset is downloaded from week 3, Machine Learning Coursera. Model Accuracy 89%

# Linear_Regression_Python

This code is the Python implementation of the Linear Regression problem on AndrewNg's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.  
This simple machine learning model predicts profits for a food truck.  
Dataset is downloaded from the course assignment under week1.    

Edit - Added the solution to the Multivariate Linear Regression problem which predicts the Housing Prices based on 2 parameters : number of bedrooms and 
Size of the house in square feet.
